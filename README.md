🙏 Credits & Inspiration

This project was inspired by a tutorial from
Adrian Hajdin (JavaScript Mastery).

I used the tutorial as a foundation to understand architecture and real-world implementation, and then customized, extended, and built ArcPrep as part of my learning journey.

ArcPrep is part of my ongoing 120-day development journey, where I build real-world applications, learn modern technologies, and sharpen my problem-solving and development skills.
